# SearchAndSort

This goes over mostly Sorting Algorithms.  This is done in Java in generic coding. 
It uses an abstract class called Sort that contains two methods, ascending and descending sorts.
It also uses a class that prints the array as well as a class that swaps two elements in an array;

Contains the following Algorithms:

Search: Linear Search O(n)

Sort: Bubble Sort O(n^2) -- Insertion Sort O(n^2) -- Merge Sort O(nlog(n)) -- Quick Sort O(nlog(n)) -- Selection Sort O(n^2)
